# Product Requirements Document Template
## Summary
 - A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a detailed guide that defines the scope, functionality, and features of a product or feature being developed. It serves as a blueprint for all the stakeholders involved in the development process, including engineers, designers, product managers, and marketing teams. 

 - The PRD ensures that everyone has a shared understanding of what the product is and how it will work. Outlined sections in the markdown sample PRD covers these sections, and should be varied depending on how the individual PM, and product team want to operate. 

## Repo Purpose
 - Consider this a guide for a PM to start from, and edit as much as possible. Too much noise will leave the signal of the PRD lost.
 - Use the markdown as a form or template to start from. The sections considered are below for reference.

 1. Overview / Introduction

 - - Purpose: Explains why the product or feature is being developed, the problem it is solving, and the high-level goals.
 - - Objective: A concise statement of the project’s primary goal.
 - - Stakeholders: A list of key people involved in the project, such as product managers, developers, designers, QA, and other business units.

2. Product Scope

 - - In-Scope Features: Details the functionalities and features the product will include.
 - - Out-of-Scope Features: Clearly lists what is not included in this phase of the project to avoid scope creep.
 - - Assumptions: Any assumptions or dependencies required for the successful development of the product (e.g., reliance on external APIs or third-party services).

3. User Stories / Use Cases

 - - User Persona(s): Describes the target users, their goals, pain points, and how they will interact with the product.
 - - User Stories: Specific stories or scenarios explaining how different users will interact with the product. Example: “As a user, I want to be able to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account.”
 - - Acceptance Criteria: Conditions that must be met for the user story to be considered complete.

4. Functional Requirements

 - - Feature Description: Detailed breakdown of each feature or component of the product. This section often includes wireframes or mockups.
 - - System Behavior: Describes how the system should respond to specific inputs or actions from the user or environment.
 - - Workflows: Flowcharts or step-by-step processes for how users will move through the product or system.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

 - - Performance: Speed, scalability, and efficiency requirements.
 - - Security: Authentication, authorization, and any data protection standards.
 - - Reliability: Uptime, failover plans, and error recovery processes.
 - - Usability: User experience and accessibility standards.
 - - Compatibility: Supported browsers, devices, or operating systems.

6. Design and UX

 - - UI/UX Designs: Mockups, wireframes, or prototypes that demonstrate the visual design and layout.
 - - Style Guidelines: References to branding, fonts, colors, and UI components.
 - - Interaction Design: Describes how users will interact with the product (buttons, forms, animations).

7. Technical Requirements

 - - Platform: Details the technology stack, frameworks, or languages that will be used to build the product.
 - - APIs: List of external or internal APIs that need to be integrated or developed.
 - - Data Requirements: Any necessary data formats, structures, databases, and storage solutions.
 - - Architecture Diagrams: High-level architecture of how various components will work together.

8. Performance Metrics / KPIs

 - - Success Criteria: Key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success, such as user adoption rates, system performance, or revenue goals.
 - - Analytics: Tracking and logging requirements, such as which analytics tools will be used (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.).

9. Release Criteria

 - - Timeline / Milestones: A roadmap of the product’s development with key dates and release phases (alpha, beta, production).
 - - Deployment Plan: Instructions or strategies for how the product will be released to users (staged rollouts, canary releases, etc.).
 - - Support Plan: Any ongoing support or maintenance required post-release.

10. Risks & Dependencies

 - - Risks: Identifies potential obstacles or challenges (e.g., reliance on third-party services, team capacity issues, etc.).
 - - Mitigation Plan: Steps or strategies to address these risks.

11. Appendices

 - - Glossary: Definitions of any technical terms, acronyms, or jargon.
 - - References: Links or documents that provide additional context, such as technical specifications or research.

### Why a PRD is Important
 - A well-written PRD ensures that the team understands:

 - - What is being built (scope and features).
 - - Why it’s being built (objectives and use cases).
 - - How it will be built (functional, technical, and design requirements).
 - - When it will be delivered (roadmap and release timeline).
 - - Who is responsible for each part of the process (stakeholders and teams).

 - Takeaway: The PRD helps avoid miscommunication, reduces scope creep, and aligns everyone toward a common goal.
